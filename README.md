Level IOS app


In my final submission, I was not able to implement the back end that i attempted to. I tried several different methods but ran into errors with all of them.

These included both swift specfic methods, and third party methods. 

Overall I learned a great deal from completing this assingment, as i have never developed an ios app before.

Thank you for the seminar, i learned a great deal.

best,
Nick Titzler
